# Toxic Situation: A Bi-Coastal Perspective

Project Description/Outline: Our project is to shine light on the effect of pollution to the Western and Eastern Coastal Regions of the United States. We'll examine relationships between the types of pollutants found on each coast, the effects it has on biodiversity (on water), highlight efforts to rectifying this problem, and more.

Research Questions: What type of pollutants are predominantly found in these areas? What are the source of the top two/three primary sources of pollution in these areas? How long has pollutants collected in these regions (specify trends in changes)? What can we do to help truncate the number of pollution built up?

Datasets to be Used:

Hypothesis:
The west coast has more non-point pollution, and the east coast has more point-pollution, based on the density of oil rigs and oil spills in these regions, based on the last 5 years. The west coast has more non-point pollution based on coastal population density and GDP and environmental regulations.

Leading Questions:
How much non-point and point pollution is on each coast?
Non-point - oceanconservancy website
Point - NOAA

What is the population density for each coast?
